Abstract
--------

      This demo shows how to use the java::* commands to create GUI
      components and handle user events. It also shows how a grid
      like command can be constructed around a GridBagLayoutManager.

Why Bother?
-----------

      The java::* commands can be used to do rapid development of AWT-
      based GUI applications.  Forget all the fuss of implementing
      event interfaces, using inner classes, etc., to handle
      events.  Just use the java::bind command!

Running The Demo
----------------
     To see the demo in action start out by typing "make demos" in the
     directory you compiled in. This will create a demos subdirectory
     in the directory you compiled in. At this point you will want to
     start up a java enabled shell and source the gridDemo.tcl file. The
     easiest way to do this is to type "make shell" and then cd to the
     demos/gridDemo directory that was created inside the directory
     you compiled in. At this point you can just type "source gridDemo.tcl"
     at the Tcl prompt.

     Now you can select the employees to fire by selecting their
     names and clicking on the arrow buttons.
