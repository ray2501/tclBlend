Abstract
--------

      This demo shows how the java::* command can be used to create
      a layout manager for java widgets that acts just like the pack
      command from tk.

Running The Demo
----------------
     To see the demo in action start out by typing "make demos" in the
     directory you compiled in. This will create a demos subdirectory
     in the directory you compiled in. At this point you will want to
     start up a java enabled shell and source the packDemo.tcl file. The
     easiest way to do this is to type "make shell" and then cd to the
     demos/packDemo directory that was created inside the directory
     you compiled in.

     Now source the packDemo.tcl file. After doing that you should see
     some java widgets packed into a window. Read the packDemo.tcl file
     to see how easy it was to pack java widgets using tcl commands.
     You can compare this code to the code in wishDemo.tcl which does
     the exact same thing using tk buttons and the tk pack command
     (go ahead source them both, its fun!). You can also see how the
     pack layout manager can be used directly from java by looking at
     the packDemo.java file. You can run the packDemo.java example by
     typing "java packDemo" at the command line.
