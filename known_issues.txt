(Jacl under Windows)
Many test cases will fail if Jacl is built or installed into
a directory that has a space in the name. For example, the
Mingw directory /tmp may be mapped to:
C:\Documents and Settings\$USERNAME\Local Settings\Temp.
Be sure to avoid building or installing into a directory
that has a space in the name when running Jacl test cases.

(Jacl under Windows)
JDK 1.5 encoder/decoder support is known to be broken for
far east encodings like shiftjis.

(Jacl tests under Solaris)
If you configure with --srcdir, and don't have write permission in
the source directory, then some of the Jacl tests in tcl/fileName.test
will fail.  Also, tcl/info.test will fail with a message
about 'cannot open file: gorp.info'

(AWT modal dialogs)
Users have run into serious problems with AWT modal dialogs under Jacl
and Tcl Blend. The problem is caused by the way the AWT blocks calling
threads for modal dialogs. Both Jacl and Tcl Blend will "freeze"
if the AWT modal dialog show method is called from inside Tcl. A
workaround for this problem has been developed and added as an
unsupported command. The name of this command is unsupported::jdetachcall.
It works just jike java::call except that it will not block and it
will work for instance and static methods. This method should only
be used for blocking AWT like calls!
