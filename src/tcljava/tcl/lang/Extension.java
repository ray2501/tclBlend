 * Base class for all Tcl Extensions. A Tcl Extension defines a set of
 * commands that can be loaded into an Interp as a single unit.
 *
 * When a Tcl Extension is loaded into an Interp, either statically
 * (using the "new" operator inside Java code) or dynamically (using
 * the java::load command in Tcl scripts), it usually creates a set of
 * commands inside the interpreter. Occasionally, loading an Extension
 * may lead to additional side effects. For example, a communications
 * Extension may open network connections when it's loaded. Please
 * refer to the documentation of the specific Extension for details.
